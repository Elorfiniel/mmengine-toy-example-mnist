# Trained Models

**[Note]** This directory is not part of the "mmengine toy example". It merely lists the checkpoints obtained from the default configs. If you do not want to train the model from scratch on your own (which is easy), run testing script with the following checkpoints.

| Config                                             | Model    | Checkpoint                         |
